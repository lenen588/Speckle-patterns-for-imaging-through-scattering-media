# Speckle-patterns-for-imaging-through-scattering-media
Speckle pattern datasets for imaging through scattering media. Targets are selected from MNIST handwritten digits, EMNIST handwritten letters, and fashion MNIST. The speckles are produced by 120, 220, 600, and 1500 grit ground glass diffusers. The diffuser plane operates displacements and rotations in x, y, and z axes. 
This dataset contains speckle patterns collected by optical imaging systems.
We utilize four diffusers to produce speckle patterns, i.e., 120, 220, 600, and 1500 grit diffusers (Thorlabs, DG10-
120, DG10-220, DG10-600, and DG10-1500) as the scattering media.
Moreover, we consider three scattering conditions of the diffuser plane, i.e., the displacements, the rotations, and the combination of the displacements and the rotations. We consider three axes, i.e., x, y, and z axis to perform the displacements and rotations. For x-axis, we consider -5~5 mm displacements with 1mm interval and -0.5~0.5° with 0.1° interval. For y-axis, we consider -15~15 mm displacements with 1mm interval and -0.5~0.5° with 0.1° interval. For z-axis, we consider -5~5 mm displacements with 1mm interval and -0.5~0.5° with 0.1° interval. 
The imaging targets are selected from MNIST handwritten digits, EMNIST handwritten letters, and fashion MNIST.
The image size of the speckle patterns and targets is 256*256 pixels.
